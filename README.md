## Filtration Strategies for Movie Recommendation Systems

Movie recommendation systems use a set of different filtration strategies and algorithms to help users find the most relevant films. The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems.

â€” **Content-Based Filtering**
A filtration strategy for movie recommendation systems, which uses the data provided about the items (movies). This data plays a crucial role here and is extracted from only one user. An ML algorithm used for this strategy recommends motion pictures that are similar to the userâ€™s preferences in the past. Therefore, the similarity in content-based filtering is generated by the data about the past film selections and likes by only one user.
